<sm style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Production in manufacturing firms in high income countries is generally becoming
cleaner. Some of this trend has been shown to be due to adoption of new technologies,
but carbon offshoring – i.e. when dirty production at home is replaced with imports
of carbon-intensive products from abroad – may be an additional factor. If so, this
is concerning, since it risks undermining climate policies by simply moving emissions
to countries with laxer regulations. This is the focus of this paper. Leveraging rich
product-level data encompassing production, trade, and emissions from Swedish manufacturing firms, the paper examines how firms adjust their production decisions in
response to supply shocks within their trading partner markets. Employing a combination of shift-share instrumental variables and a difference-in-difference estimation
approach, the analysis reveals that carbon offshoring activities leads to a substantial
reduction in average production-based emission intensity. In fact, a 10% increase in the
import of energy-intensive goods can result in firms’ production processes becoming
5% cleaner. This suggests that carbon leakage is a valid policy concern. However, my
results also show that the positive effect on production-based emissions is partly counteracted by a negative effect through increased transportation emissions, and it is not
clear what the overall effect on emissions will be. Further, the effect of offshoring on
production emissions also depends on the type of offshoring. For instance, offshoring
in the form of FDI has a much larger emissions-reducing effect than offshoring in the
form of imports of inputs not produced in-firm.

 <a >**Energy Cost and Competitiveness Risk**</a> 
<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>
While raising the carbon price is an effective tool for decreasing reliance on carbon-intensive production sources, it has also raised substantial concerns among policymakers that  higher energy cost will render manufacturing firms less competitive and potentially lead to increased consumer prices. In this paper, I examined the impact of energy prices on manufacturing firms  by using a shift-share instrument and an event-style difference-in-difference approaches that isolate the exogenous variation in firm-specific energy prices. The analysis reveals a dual impact of energy price inflation. On one hand, energy price shock contributes to positive environmental outcomes by reducing energy consumption and $CO_2$ emissions. On the other hand, it exerts detrimental effects on firms' productivity, employment, and the risk of potential carbon leakage. Furthermore, firms demonstrate a propensity to shift the cost burdens to consumers, exacerbating general inflation in the economy. The results show varying levels of heterogeneity across manufacturing sectors, including energy-intensive and EU-ETS firms, as well as across different occupations. Overall, the findings suggest a trade-off between environmental and economic goals due to increasing energy taxes

 <a>**Green Manufacturing Transitioning -- The Role of Localized Import Competition**</a> - <sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i> Joint with Zouheir El‑Sahli (Draft soon)</i></sm>

<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
There is evidence that increased import competition can lead to a reduction in domestic emissions, as domestic producers may adopt more efficient production processes in order to remain competitive with imported goods. However, this effect may not always be present, especially when nationwide import competition is assumed.  We contribute to the literature by first, investigating whether the distance between producers and importers, within a country, matters for import competition. We then asses how localized import competition effects on firm's environmental performance.  Using detailed geographical information about the location of all manufacturing firms in Sweden during the period 2005-2014, we find evidence that domestic production becomes more energy efficient in trade exposed areas. % but the effect decreases with the distance between the producer and the importer. However, the effect decreases with the distance between the producer and the importer. We find that the effect is driven by  productivity spillovers, production adjustment decisions by producers (changes in product mix), innovation and abatement investment.
