[**Carbon Offshoring and Manufacturing Cleanup**]() 

<sm style="font-size: 0.8em;">
In recent years, the manufacturing sector in many rich countries has managed to expand its output without a corresponding increase in emissions.  I study how carbon offshoring -- import of carbon intensive inputs,  and concentration of manufacturing plants in countries with laxer environmental policies -- have contributed to the manufacturing cleanup. First, I utilize detailed product-level data on production, trade, and emissions from Swedish manufacturing firms to examine how these firms adjust their production decisions in response to supply shocks in trading partner markets. Next, employing a shift-share instrument and a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, I demonstrate that carbon offshoring activities lead improved cleaner production but while causing a short run increase in transport pollution. These findings suggest carbon offshoring could mask firms overall environmental performance and undermine local environmental policies. Latter results emphasize that the role of environmental policy arbitrage in this effect is nontrivial, and clean-up efforts are highly unevenly distributed among sectors.

 [**Energy Cost and Competitive Risk: An Implication for Climate  Policies**]()   
<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
In this paper, I examined the impact of energy prices on manufacturing firms  by using a shift-share instrument and an event-style difference-in-difference approaches that isolate the exogenous variation in firm-specific energy prices. The analysis reveals a dual impact of energy price inflation. On one hand, energy price shock contributes to positive environmental outcomes by reducing energy consumption and $CO_2$ emissions. On the other hand, it exerts detrimental effects on firms' productivity, employment, and the risk of potential carbon leakage. Furthermore, firms demonstrate a propensity to shift the cost burdens to consumers, exacerbating general inflation in the economy. The results demonstrate varying levels of heterogeneity across manufacturing sectors, including energy-intensive and EU-ETS firms, as well as across different occupations. Overall, these results suggest a trade-off between environmental and economic goals due to increasing energy taxes.

[**Green Manufacturing Transitioning -- The Role of Localized Import Competition**]()   
<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
There is evidence that increased import competition can lead to a reduction in domestic emissions, as domestic producers may adopt more efficient production processes in order to remain competitive with imported goods. However, this effect may not always be present, especially when nationwide import competition is assumed.  We contribute to the literature by first, investigating whether the distance between producers and importers, within a country, matters for import competition. We then asses how localized import competition effects on firm's environmental performance.  Using detailed geographical information about the location of all manufacturing firms in Sweden during the period 2005-2014, we find evidence that domestic production becomes more energy efficient in trade exposed areas. % but the effect decreases with the distance between the producer and the importer. However, the effect decreases with the distance between the producer and the importer. We find that the effect is driven by  productivity spillovers, production adjustment decisions by producers (changes in product mix), innovation and abatement investment.
