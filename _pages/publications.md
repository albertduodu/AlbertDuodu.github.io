[**Offshoring and Manufacturing Cleanup**]() 

<sm style="font-size: 0.8em;">
A large share of carbon emissions arises from the production of goods and from burning fossil fuel. However, between 2007 and 2014, air pollution emissions from Sweden’s manufacturing fell by 29 percent despite a substantial increase in manufacturing output. In this paper, I exploit detailed product-level information on production, trade and emissions for Swedish manufacturing firms to estimate how firms adjust their production decisions in response to supply shocks in trading partner markets. Using a shift-share instrument, I show that offshoring can lead to a significant reduction in firms emission intensity and the role environmental policy arbitrage plays in this effect is nontrivial. The latter results show that clean-ups are highly unevenly distributed among sectors. Dirty industries benefits more in terms of emission efficiency, and highly productive firms such as multinationals can combine both imports of (dirty) inputs and over-concentration of affiliates in laxer countries to significantly reduce carbon footprints. The findings suggest that harmonising environmental policies may be an effective way to address climate change and other ecological crises.

 [**Energy Prices, Competitiveness Risk and Carbon Leakage**]()   

<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
This paper investigates the effect of energy prices on firm competitiveness and carbon leakage using a novel micro-level data of Swedish Manufacturing firms in the period 2007-2014. Using a shift-share instrument that isolates the exogenous variation in firm-specific energy prices, I show that the impact of energy prices (a proxy of environmental regulations) on productivity, employment and import of energy-intensive products is non-trivial and heterogeneous. First, I estimate that a 10% increase in energy prices at firm level leads to a 0.18% decrease firm productivity, 5% decline in employment and a small insignificant impact on input import. The negative effect on employment varies across sectors and occupations. The negative impact on employment does not disproportionately affect low-skilled workers and is biased in favor of full-time employees. By simulating the introduction EU-ETS, I find that the effect is amplified in EU-ETS firms, and energy-intensive sectors.

[**Green Transitioning and Localized Import Competition**]()   
<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
There is evidence that increased import competition can lead to a reduction in domestic emissions, as domestic producers may adopt more efficient production processes in order to remain competitive with imported goods. However, this effect may not always be present, especially when nationwide import competition is assumed. I contribute to the literature by investigating whether the distance between producers and importers, within a country, matters for import competition effects on firm's environmental performance. Using detailed geographical information about the location of all manufacturing firms in Sweden during the period 2005-2014, I find evidence that domestic production becomes more energy efficient when imports increase. However, if producers are in close proximity with polluting firms, the impact of import exposure falls. In addition to the importance of the geographical pattern within a country, my findings show that the average effect of import competition masks significant variations across firms and products. Highly productive firms respond to import competition by improving environmental performance. These firms are also more likely to reduce production of (dirty) products while continuing to produce core ones.
