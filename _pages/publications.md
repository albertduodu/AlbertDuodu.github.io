[**Carbon Offshoring and Manufacturing Cleanup**]() 

<sm style="font-size: 0.8em;">
In many developed countries, pollution stemming from manufacturing has decreased, despite a significant rise in output. I study how carbon offshoring -- import of carbon intensive inputs,  and concentration of manufacturing plants in countries with laxer environmental policies -- have contributed to the manufacturing cleanup. First, I exploit detailed product-level data on production, trade, and emissions of Swedish manufacturing firms to examine how firms adjust their production decisions in response to supply shocks in trading partner markets. Next, using a shift-share instrument and difference-in-difference estimation strategy, I show that carbon offshoring activities lead to a substantial reduction in firms' emission intensity. Moving away from emissions due to production to transport, I find that carbon offshoring tend to result in increased transport pollution in the short run.  Latter results show that the role of environmental policy arbitrage in this effect is nontrivial, and clean-ups are highly unevenly distributed among sectors.  These findings suggest that the harmonization of environmental policies  and carbon border adjustment mechanism could serve as an effective strategy to tackling  carbon leakage.

 [**Competitiveness Risk and Energy Cost Pass-through: A micro-level analysis of energy price impact on Swedish firms**]()   
<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
In this paper, I examined the impact of energy prices on manufacturing firms  by using a shift-share instrument and an event-style difference-in-difference approaches that isolate the exogenous variation in firm-specific energy prices. The analysis reveals a dual impact of energy price inflation. On one hand, energy price shock contributes to positive environmental outcomes by reducing energy consumption and $CO_2$ emissions. On the other hand, it exerts detrimental effects on firms' productivity, employment, and the risk of potential carbon leakage. Furthermore, firms demonstrate a propensity to shift the cost burdens to consumers, exacerbating general inflation in the economy. The results demonstrate varying levels of heterogeneity across manufacturing sectors, including energy-intensive and EU-ETS firms, as well as across different occupations. Overall, these results suggest a trade-off between environmental and economic goals due to increasing energy taxes.

[**Green Manufacturing Transitioning -- The Role of Localized Import Competition**]()   
<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
There is evidence that increased import competition can lead to a reduction in domestic emissions, as domestic producers may adopt more efficient production processes in order to remain competitive with imported goods. However, this effect may not always be present, especially when nationwide import competition is assumed.  We contribute to the literature by first, investigating whether the distance between producers and importers, within a country, matters for import competition. We then asses how localized import competition effects on firm's environmental performance.  Using detailed geographical information about the location of all manufacturing firms in Sweden during the period 2005-2014, we find evidence that domestic production becomes more energy efficient in trade exposed areas. % but the effect decreases with the distance between the producer and the importer. However, the effect decreases with the distance between the producer and the importer. We find that the effect is driven by  productivity spillovers, production adjustment decisions by producers (changes in product mix), innovation and abatement investment.
