Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I am currently a 4th year PhD student at [Lund University](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/albert-duodu).

I work at the intersection of international trade and environment - with particular interest in applied microeconometrics and spatial analysis. 

I am particularly interested in how the interplay of international trade, offshoring and environmental policies contribute to the enormous heterogeneity of emissions at the firm-level; the consequences of asymmetric implementation and enforcement of environmental policies and the spatial dimension of economic activities and emissions of producers.
