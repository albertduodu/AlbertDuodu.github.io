Hi! Welcome to my homepage. I am currently in the 4th year of my PhD in Economics at [Lund University](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/albert-duodu).


My primary research interests revolve around Energy & Environmental Economics, International Trade, and Development Economics, with a particular focus on applied microeconometrics and spatial analysis.

In my research, I explore the complex interactions between environmental policies, international trade, and their impact on firms' emissions. I am also interested in understanding the implications of asymmetric implementation and enforcement of environmental policies on firms and consumers. Additionally, I investigate the spatial dimension of economic activities and how they influence emissions of producers
