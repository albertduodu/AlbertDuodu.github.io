Hi! Welcome to my homepage. 
I am a **PhD Candidate** in **Economics** at <a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/albert-duodu" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">Lund University</a>.  I am on the 2023/2024 job market and will be available for interviews.


My primary research interests revolve around  **International Trade**, and **Environmental Economics**, with a particular focus on applied microeconometrics and spatial analysis.  In my research I explore the drivers of green manufacturing transitioning and the implications of asymmetric implementation and enforcement of environmental policies on firms and consumers.
