I am currently a 4th year PhD student at [Lund University](https://www.nek.lu.se/en).

I work at the intersection of international trade and environment - with particular interest in applied microeconometrics and spatial analysis. I am particularly interested in how the interplay of international trade, offshoring and environmental policies contribute to the enormous heterogeneity of emissions at the firm-level; the consequences asymmetric implementation and enforcement of environmental policies could have on manufacturing firms and the spatial dimension of economic activities, specifically the impact of import competition on the emissions of producers.).
